      THHS Simbucks is a website developed for managing simbucks remotely during the yearly THHS election simulation. 
      Candidates and interest groups will be able to sell goods on a virtual marketplace to voters composed of the freshmen, sophomores and juniors
      of THHS in exchange for virtual simbucks. Using these simbucks, candidates and interest groups will be able to buy ads, TV, and radio
      time. We hope that you will still be able to enjoy a staple of the Townsend Harris experience regardless of the quarantine. Stay strong!
